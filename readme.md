7. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/juiceclient-clock-script.git

8. Open in Code Editor

Navigate to the project folder and open it in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode).

9. Modify Script (Optional)

You can easily modify the script to suit your needs:

Themes: Customize the clock's colors in the themes object within the script.

Position: By default, the clock is centered at the top. Adjust the top and left values in clockContainer.style to reposition it.

Font Size: Change the default font size in the script by modifying the fontSize value.

üêû Troubleshooting

Error: Cannot read property 'appendChild' of nullThis occurs if the document.body element is not available when the script runs. The script waits until the body is fully loaded to append the clock. Ensure the script is being loaded after the page content.

Clock Not AppearingIf the clock doesn't show up, ensure JuiceClient is correctly configured to load custom scripts. Check for any style or script conflicts that may be affecting the display.
